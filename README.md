# Just a very barebones PHP login system

_Please note that this is is still WIP._

This project started as a simple school assignment for some PHP course I was attending. Then I needed this kind of system for some website I was making and decided to start expanding. Word of warning: This project is/will be very opinionated, meaning that I will only add features that I myself find useful or interesting enough to develop.

## Some basic info

* It should be secure enough for general use. I take no responsibility tho.
* It uses PHP's `password_hash()` function to hash and salt the passwords. Usernames are saved as a plain text.
  * I'm using `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` which at time of the writing uses BCRYPT.
* It requires MySQL database. More info about setting up your database below.
* I have only tested it in PHP 7.0 and above but it should work all the way down to 5.5.0.
